### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This helped me to learn more about web layout in CSS and provided me an easy way to make complex but structured layouts easily. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Learn flexbox the easy way](hhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand how to use CSS flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
